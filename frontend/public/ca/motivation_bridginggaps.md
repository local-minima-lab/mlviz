## Bridging Gaps Through Visualisation

-   intuitions between ML can be hard to understand
    -   wide-spread availability of ready-to-use libraries
-   mediate these gaps through visualisation
    -   proven performance improvements (with regards to grades) (Kogan et. al, 2014)
    -   study showing student learn more concepts (Kumar, 2016)
-   not a magic bullet
    -   visualisations are educational if they enable students to construct own understanding
    -   activity accompanying the visualisation is equally as important
