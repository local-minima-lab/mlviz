# Your time to shine!

A small town has set up a hotline after a storm with **10 solved requests**. The responder is responsible to send out the relevant team (think Dispatch, but less fun).

However, the responder is tired and has to clock his mandatory 7 hours of rest. You have been asked to now respond to the requests, but you have no idea how to do it, other than the history of his solved requests.

Each request comes with 6 clues (features) that are simple, observable signals a dispatcher can record quickly, and have been labeled with what they did.

You’re not trying to be perfect - you're new to the job. You’re trying to be consistent, explainable, and fast. Thus, you want to make a decision tree.Every rule you add should make the decision easier to defend

The twist is that some calls look similar, but one clue can change everything. Your tree will be that set of “key questions” a dispatcher asks
