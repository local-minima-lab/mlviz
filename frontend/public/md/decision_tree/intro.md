# Welcome

This story will teach you about the decision tree!

## Today's objectives

- What you’ll learn
    - What a decision tree is (a sequence of if/else questions)

    - How it chooses splits during training

    - How it makes a prediction for one example

    - Common failure modes (overfitting) and how to control them

- Why decision trees are useful
    - Interpretable: you can read the logic

    - Works on mixed feature types (numeric/categorical)

    - Fast inference (just walk down the tree)

- Mental model
    - A tree is just repeated: “pick a feature + rule → split data → repeat”
